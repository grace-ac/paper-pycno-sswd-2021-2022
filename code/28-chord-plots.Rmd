Circos plot of DEGs from the study. 

ðŸ”§ Concept:
A circular ideogram with three arcs:
â€¢ Arc A: DEGs from Adult-only experiment
â€¢ Arc B: DEGs from Age-structured experiment
â€¢ Arc C: Shared DEGs, with immune-related genes highlighted
â€¢ Chords (connecting bands) link genes that appear in:
â€¢ Multiple experiments
â€¢ Multiple GO/KEGG immune pathways

It seems like Circos isn't an R package... but there is an R package called `circlize` that i'll use.
