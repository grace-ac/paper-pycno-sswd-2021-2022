# WARNING - This exported Revigo data is only useful for the specific purpose of constructing a TreeMap visualization.
# Do not use this table as a general list of non-redundant GO categories, as it sets an extremely permissive 
# threshold to detect redundancies (c=0.10) and fill the 'representative' column, while normally c>=0.4 is recommended.
# To export a reduced-redundancy set of GO terms, go to the Scatterplot or Table tab, and export from there.
