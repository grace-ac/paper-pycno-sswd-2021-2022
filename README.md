# Project Summaries

## Summer 2021
In the summer of 2021, adult _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ were collected (Permit: Harvell 21-1172) by a team of WDFW divers and brought to USGS Marrowstone Field Station.

Stars were observed for several weeks and any that showed signs of disease were not used for experiments.

Experiments A and B were performed, detailed below.

## Experiment Summer 2021     
Questions:     
1. Is Sea Star Wasting Disease transmissible?
2. If yes, is the causative agent in the small size fraction?

Multiple tissue types from an adult _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ wasting from the field were blended together using a Tissue Tearor ([link](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/tissue-tearor-985370-07-homogenizer-120-vac-1-2-a/0475050?PubID=UX&persist=true&ip=no&gclid=CjwKCAjwrPCGBhALEiwAUl9X00o0irSQs7AKUaOLOGs76axgNqO4FTM0G04iCkhs37O35X64jM_F4BoC2skQAvD_BwE); Tissue Tearor 985370-07 Homogenizer; 120 VAC, 1.2 A). The sample was then spun down to pellet larger bits of tissue. The supernatant was then used as the inoculum for experiments.

The following inoculate types were made fresh for each experiment (note: 0.45um filtered only made for Experiment A):   
1. Heat-killed (control): supernatant was placed in a falcon tube and held in boiling water with a stir bar for 10 minutes
2. 0.45um filtered (exposed): supernatant was filtered through a vacuum bottle unit - flow-through is larger viruses and bacteria
3. unfiltered (exposed): supernatant was unfiltered, so it would contain anything from a large protist to a small virus

Experiment A began on 9/23/2021. Stars were injected with either 0.45micron filtered live tissue homogenate from a wasting star (microbial group), heat-killed tissue homogenate from a wasting star (control group), or unfiltered live tissue homogenate from a wasting star (exposed group). Stars were observed 2x daily and sampled at disease sign along with control pair. The RNAseq data timeline control and exposed groups are not balanced due to lack of sufficient RNA for sequencing for some samples. Comparisons made for those libraries are shared below under the title “Experiment A”.

Experiment B began on 10/05/2021. Stars were injected with heat-killed tissue homogenate from a wasting star (control group) or unfiltered live tissue homogenate from a wasting star (exposed group). Some of the control stars in this experiment were previously injected with the 0.45micron filtered live tissue homogenate in Experiment A but never showed any disease signs, and so they became part of the control group. They continued to remain disease-sign free throughout the remainder of Experiment B. Comparisons made between libraries from Experiment B are shared below under the title “Experiment B”.

### September 23, 2021 - (Experiment A)
- Control: n=13 stars injected with heat-killed inoculum
- Exposed: n=12 stars injected with 0.45um filtered live inoculum
- Exposed: n=4 stars injected with unfiltered live inoculum

### October 5, 2021 - October 18, 2021 (Experiment B)
- Control: n=9 stars injected with heat-killed inoculum
- Exposed: n=9 stars injected with unfiltered live inoculum

### June 21, 2022 - July 8, 2022 (Experiment C)
- Control Juveniles: n=15 stars injected with heat-killed inoculum
- Control Adults: n=14 stars injected with heat-killed inoculum
- Exposed Juveniles: n=15 stars injected with unfiltered live inoculum
- Exposed Adults: n=15 stars injected with unfiltered live inoculum
